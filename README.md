### Hi there 👋

I am a Web Developer that focuses on React, Nodejs, UI Design, and Serverless technologies such as Gatsby and Firebase.

**My Online Presence**: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suxyue/) | [Dev.to](https://dev.to/yuesu)

### 💻 I'm working on

Currently, I am working on a project that aims to migrate a company's website from WordPress to a JAM stack (Gatsby + Contentful).

The more I use Gatsby the more I appreciate the benefits in terms of server-side rendering. The loading speed is lightning fast ⚡, and there are tons of plugins that you can utilize for sourcing any type of content. It could be a Markdown file, a dropbox folder, or even a google sheet.

### 🌱 I'm learning

While I'm trying to go deep in React and Javascript, the next thing I really want to learn is **functional programming** and **Typescript**. As I realized that learning libraries or frameworks are more like a sprint, not a long-running one. Having a solid understanding of the basic concepts of function serves the purpose to improve the overall code quality and be more confident about the outcome.

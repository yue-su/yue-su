### 💻 I'm working on

Currently, I am working on a project that aims to migrate a company's website from WordPress to a JAM stack (Gatsby + GraphQL + Contentful).

Here is a [preview](https://www.helenge.com/) of the website if you are interested.

### 🌱 I'm learning

While I'm trying to go deep in React and Javascript, the next thing I really want to learn is **functional programming** and **Typescript**. As I realized that learning libraries or frameworks are more like a sprint, not a long-running one. Having a solid understanding of the basic concepts of function serves the purpose to improve the overall code quality and be more confident about the outcome.
